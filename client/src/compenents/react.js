                    <h1>React Native: An ultimate choice for startups, SMEs, and large enterprises</h1>
                    <p>React Native is a Javascript framework to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android.<br /> We create mobile applications identical to an application built using Swift for iOS or Java for Android.<br /> Our React Native developers build cross-platform apps that are functionally powerful and excellent user experience.

                        At TriState Technology, we build React Native apps with which the time-to-market becomes faster without compromising on the app performance.<br /> Being an open-source framework, React Native provides us the flexibility and capabilities to<br /> build high-quality and super-efficient apps for other platforms like tvOS as well.

                        Our team of React Native app developers is our biggest asset when it comes to shipping successful, <br />sleek, and easy-to-use cross-platform apps.</p>
